### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
 
 ## Introduction

 My name is Alexander Llanos! Welcome to my Github Page:

 - ðŸ”­ I'm currently building a Machine Learning Model for Fantasy Football drafts! An app that allows casual and serious FFB players alike get an edge when it comes time to draft your players. No live site is currently up yet.

 - ðŸ”­ Previous project I worked on is [TwoMinuteDrill](https://two-minute-drill.onrender.com/) An app that allows users to create customizeable football contests and enter contests that others have made.
